# Notes

Hello, I'm Ryan and this is the repo for my notes and thoughts (also a bit of a UI playground for me to experiment with a few ideas).

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Posts are markdown files in the `notes` directory.

Themes are located in `components/Theme/index.js` and imported in `components/Layout` and `components/Header`
