For the past year, I've pondered whether to begin writing and sharing about the things I'm tinkering with - not only as a way to pull back the curtain a bit on desiging products, but also a way to begin tracking my own progress on learning new things.

So I'll be starting to document my journey in learning and building new things. Expect to see sketches and ideas about some of the recent tools and ideas I've been playing with:

- Figma Plugins
- Design Token tooling
- SwiftUI
- React, Next.js, Gatsby
- Firebase

Besides design/development tools, I've also been thinking about how teams are structured and what's working for my current team, and what doesn't.

Stay tuned!
